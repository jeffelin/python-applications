# Overview of Tic Tac Toe 

Main.py runs the functions. Testing.py runs the code. The game accepts values 1 and 2 corresponding to Players 1 and 2 that runs as a Tic Tac Toe game with diagonals, rows, and verticals. They alternate between Player 1 and 2's input, which is the desired column and row. I had a lot of help from https://pythonprogramming.net/. 

Experiment folder are some added code that goes beyond with me testing different questions with Tic Tac Toe (i.e. How do we optimize a Tic Tac Toe game with AI?)

"In zero-sum games, the minimax solution is the same as the Nash equilibrium" (second statement of contents of the article about Minimax). So the existence of Nash equilibrium is a generalization of the Minimax theorem."
